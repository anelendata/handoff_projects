# handoff project collection

A collection of [handoff](https://github.com/anelendata/handoff)'s example
projects.

handoff version 0.3 has not been released yet. To try these recipes before the
release, please install handoff by:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install https://github.com/anelendata/handoff/archive/v0.3.tar.gz#egg=handoff
```
...instead of `pip install handoff` (it will install v0.2 instead until the new release.)

The recipes are not compatible to pre-v0.3. v0.2 will be obsolete and unsupported.
